# Description

This is an e-commerce backend application that utilizes Express.js and Sequelize to interact with aMySQL database. The goal of this project is to build a functional and up-to-date e-commerce websitebackend that can compete with other e-commerce companies. The acceptance criteria include creating adevelopment database, seeding it with test data, starting the server, syncing Sequelize models withthe database, and successfully performing CRUD operations on the database through API routes.Insomnia is used to test API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to ensure data is displayed in aformatted JSON and can be successfully created, updated, and deleted. A walkthrough videodemonstrating the application's functionality and meeting all of the acceptance criteria is alsorequired.
